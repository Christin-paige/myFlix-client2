## Inspiration

When I was in high school, I worked at a movie theater. I could watch any film we were showing for free, however, the blockbuster titles never intrigued me. I preferred to go to the local video store and browse the corner with the title, “Independent Films” then join the masses to watch Braveheart in the theater. I knew whichever movie I chose from this section would be exceptional and challenge my worldview and way of thinking.
This is how I approached this project to build an SPA (single-page application). Countless movie websites provide a user with every movie ever made. So I decided to build a site to attract the high school me. The one that wanted movies that were made on a budget so the writing and storyline had to sell it, not the A-list actors and expensive special effects. From this, the application was born, “IndieFilms, every film worth watching.”

## Description

IndieFilms is a client-side application written in JavaScript using React as a framework. It is connected to a movie database created in Mongo DB. MyFilms delivers a user with a list of independent films and information about each film. They can also “favorite” individual films and store them in a list on their profile page.

## Reflection

I learned so much through building my first app using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN). This was the first time creating collections in MongoDB and building the server-side of an app. I also had never used React as a framework for the client-side. If I were to do this differently, I would use a backward design perspective to building the app. I would devote more time to considering what I want the application to do and write out the steps needed to complete the build. However, I wasn’t able to do this as I was learning everything as I went. I also learned more effective and efficient ways to troubleshoot, using inspect to determine the exact root of the problem.

## Key Features

A login and signup view
A main view listing all of the movies, including an image of the movie poster
A movie view with description, genre, and director of each movie
A profile view where users can view their personal information, update information, and store their list of favorite movies

### Credits:

I want to thank my tutor at CareerFoundry as well as my mentor who provided the guidance needed and her time to show me how to troubleshoot when given a red error message, and reminding me that “The computer will only do what you tell it to do.”
